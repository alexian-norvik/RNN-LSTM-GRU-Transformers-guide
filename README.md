# RNN-LSTM-GRU-Transformers-guide

In the fast-paced world of deep learning, various architectures have emerged to address the complexity of sequential data.
Among these, `Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)`, `Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)`, `Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)`, and `Transformers` are key players, each offering unique strengths and weaknesses. These models are adept at understanding and processing infromation that comes in sequences, making them extermely useful for applications ranging from Natural Language Processing to time series forcasting.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are an essential architecture in deep learning, specifically tailored for processing sequential data. Their distinctive ability to maintain a hidden state enables them to capture temporal dependencies, making them particularly effective for tasks such as language modeling, speech recognition, and time series prediction.
